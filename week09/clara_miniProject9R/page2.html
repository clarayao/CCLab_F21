    <h1 class="page2_h1_bg">What does this poem convey?</h1>
    <ul class="b_color1">
      <li>This is a poem about <i><b>death</b></i>.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The near death of Dylan's father makes him think about death in a more general way, in which he thinks about how five different types of men would react in the face of death, and establishes these ideas in the 2-6 stanzas of the poem.</li>
      <br>
      <li>In the end, Dylan realizes that death cannot be avoided, but it can be challenged.</li>
      <br>
      <li>He thus wants to use this poem to encourage his father, as well as the others that are stuggling, to always "rage" in the face of death or even just a tiny struggle.</li>
    </ul>
